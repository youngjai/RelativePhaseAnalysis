# Simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset in Nathan Kline Institute (NKI)

Over the past several decades, many researchers have discovered that different brain regions are activated depending on the task.
The activation of the brain regions requires a higher blood oxygen level because the firing of neurons requires more energy.
For these reasons, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) is commonly used as an indirect measurement when we investigate brain analysis.
In contrast, the meaning of EEG dynamics patterns is less clear than fMRI because the EEG is measured on the surface of the scalp.
However, fMRI data has worse temporal resolution than EEG.
Because EEG and fMRI are complementary to each other, studying simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings has recently begun to attract attention.

The dataset was collected at the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI).
The recordings were obtained from 22 individuals between the ages of 23 and 51 years old.
EEG data contains 64 channels using customized Brain Products (BrainCapMR consisting of 61 cortical channels, two EOC channels placed below (channel 63) and above (channel 64) the left eye, and one ECG channel (channel 32)).
All individuals consented in accordance and compliance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at NKI.
fMRI data was acquired using a 12-channel head coil on 3T Siemens TIM Trio.
All BOLD fMRI sequences were acquired with the following parameters: $\text{TR}=2,100\text{ms}$; $\text{TE}=24.6\text{ms}$; $\text{slices}=38$; $\text{matrix size}=64\times64$; $\text{voxel size}=3.469\times3.469\times3.330 \text{mm}^3$.
