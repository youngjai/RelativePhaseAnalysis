# Codes for Kuramoto oscillators simulation
This folder contain codes for simulating Kuramoto model with a generalized coupling function, studied in [1] and [2].
Additionally, the simulation contains additional stochastic dynamics in the constant term (_c<sub>0</sub>_) in the coupling function.

To run simulation, specify the parameters in the main script `run_and_save_simulation.m`. 

## Directories
- **/func** contains relevant functions for running the simulation.
- **/mat** contains MAT data files required for simulation.
