# General anesthesia EEG recordings
EEG recordings from eighteen healthy volunteers (20-40 years old) were collected at the University of Michigan.
The study was reviewed in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Boards specializing in human subject research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Protocol #HUM0071578).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Nine participants underwent general anesthesia, the others were recorded without anesthesia.
EEG data were recorded with 128-channel HydroCel nets, Net Amps 400 amplifiers (Electrical Geodesic, Inc., USA) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz.

In the EEG data, we extracted 5-minute eyes-open and 5-minute eyes-closed resting states from the no anesthesia group (nine subjects).
In the general anesthesia group (nine subjects), we extracted five types of brain states over time to study differences among the different brain states;
1) 5-minute eyes-closed resting state before general anesthesia,
2) 3-minute loss of consciousness (LOC) state after LOC marker,
3) burst state pieces with a total of 5-minute,
4) suppression state pieces with a total of 45-minute,
5) 5-minute recovery of consciousness (ROC) state after ROC marker.

LOC and ROC markers in the EEG data were measured by responding to the verbal command ("Squeeze your left/right hand twice" with left/right randomized) every 30 seconds.
In the data, six subjects of the anesthesia group showed burst and suppression states under anesthesia.
The burst state is a period when the power in the spectrogram suddenly increases across all frequency bands even though the subjects are under anesthesia.
On the contrary, in the suppression state, the power remains extremely low.
In particular, we manually extracted the burst and suppression states because it is unclear to quantitatively define the states.
